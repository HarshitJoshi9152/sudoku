came to know about script:type = "module" \
while trying to use `import util from "C:/backup/Documents/html/javaScript/projects/js_util/utility"`


i have been able to code the sudoku box and i also realised that the reason for 
one of the lines drawn in the canvas appearing differently is most of times the possiblity that
the last/first line may not have full space to get rendered (width wise).


QUERY
we cannot use const in simple loops but we can in 

for (const i in range(1,201)) {
    console.log(i)
}

....why ?

OBS

came to know why i was getting 

VM2295:1 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property '1' of undefined
    at <anonymous>:1:9
while trying to assign sudoku values from string to array.
    sudoku[Math.floor(i/9)][i%9] = nums[i];


DUMB ERROR 1:42

i was inspecting sudokus[0][0] repetedly in the console without realising it.
i thought that the value assignment loop was only assigning the first line of sudoku_nums_string
because of this and i spent quite some time working on it.

both ways work
    for (let i = 0; i < 9; i++) 
    {
        for (let j = 0; j < 9; j++)
        {
            sudoku[i][j] = nums[acc];
            acc++
        }
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < 81; i++){
        sudoku[Math.floor(i/9)][i%9] = nums[i];
    }

1:47 removed the range function coz NO NEED OF THAT


idea of generating sudoku vs transfering pre made sudokus from the kaggle database

QUERY
    renderValueInPlace = function(val, { x, y }) 
    {
        let x = this.x + this.unit * x;
        let y = this.y + this.unit * y;
        ctx.strokeText(val, x, y)
    }

    error :
         x has already been declared

should unit be decided mathematically or should the used be able to specify it ?
    mathematically i guess; 

    constructor(x, y, unit, ctx, sudokuMap, fs)
    {
        this.sudokuMap = sudokuMap;
        this.unit = unit;
        this.x = x, this.y = y;
        this.ctx = ctx;
        this.digitPadding = unit/2;
        this.fontSize = fs
    }


this.unit = (e-s)/9; vs this.unit = e-s/9;

font size should also be decided mathematically

i want to learn about vs code tricks tips cutomisation and other cool stuff
